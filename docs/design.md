# Plot Genius Design Document

## Architecture Overview

Plot Genius is built with a modular architecture focusing on separation of concerns and performance. The main components are:

1. Application Layer
2. UI Module
3. Graph Engine
4. Rendering System
5. Configuration Management
6. Core Utilities

## Component Details

### 1. Application Layer

The application layer manages the main loop and coordinates between components:

- Window management via GLFW
- ImGui context and frame management
- Event handling and dispatch
- Resource initialization and cleanup

### 2. UI Module

The UI is built using Dear ImGui and divided into panels:

- Equation Panel: Text input and validation
- Graph Panel: Interactive plot display
- Config Panel: Settings and controls
- Style Manager: Theme and appearance

### 3. Graph Engine

The graph engine handles equation processing:

- Parser: Tokenization and AST construction
- Evaluator: Mathematical expression evaluation
- Sampler: Parallel point generation
- AST: Abstract syntax tree representation

### 4. Rendering System

The rendering system manages OpenGL resources:

- Renderer: Main rendering interface
- Buffer Manager: GPU memory management
- Shader Programs: GLSL shaders for rendering
- Vertex Management: Efficient data upload

### 5. Configuration Management

Configuration system for persistence:

- Graph Config: Plot settings structure
- Config Manager: Save/load operations
- JSON Adapter: Serialization handling

### 6. Core Utilities

Essential supporting functionality:

- Thread Pool: Parallel task execution
- Logger: Debug and performance logging
- Error Handling: Exception management

## Performance Considerations

1. **Multithreading**
   - Parallel equation evaluation
   - Asynchronous buffer updates
   - Worker thread pool for sampling

2. **GPU Optimization**
   - Persistent mapped buffers
   - Batch rendering
   - Efficient shader usage

3. **Memory Management**
   - Smart pointers for resource management
   - Buffer reuse strategies
   - Minimal copying

## Cross-Platform Support

The application is designed to work across Windows, macOS, and Linux:

- Abstracted platform-specific code
- CMake-based build system
- Standard C++17 features
- OpenGL core profile

## Future Extensions

1. **Renderer Backends**
   - Vulkan support
   - DirectX support
   - Metal support (When I can afford a Macbook ðŸ¥²)

2. **Additional Features**
   - 3D plotting
   - Animation support
   - Custom shader effects
   - Plugin system
